# 🎯 Manual Merge System - Click Each Dessert Yourself!

## 🎮 **How It Works Now**

### **Step-by-Step Manual Merging:**

1. **🔍 Find 3 identical desserts** anywhere on the 7x9 grid
2. **👆 Click the FIRST dessert** - it turns **blue** (selected)  
3. **👆 Click the SECOND identical dessert** - also turns **blue**
4. **👆 Click the THIRD identical dessert** - turns **blue** 
5. **🟢 "MERGE!" button appears** - click it to combine them!
6. **✨ Result**: 3 desserts disappear, 1 higher-level appears

## 🎨 **Visual Guide**

### **Cell Colors & Borders:**
- **🔵 Blue background + thick blue border** = Currently selected
- **🟢 Green border** = Can select (same level as current selection)
- **⬜ Gray border** = Cannot select (different level or no room)
- **💙 Blue glow shadow** = Selected desserts have special shadow effect

### **Selection Counter:**
- **"Select 3 identical desserts to merge"** = No selection yet
- **"Selected: 1/3 Cookies 🍪"** = 1 cookie selected, need 2 more
- **"Selected: 3/3 Donuts 🍩"** = Ready to merge!

## 🎛️ **Control Buttons**

### **Dynamic Buttons (appear/disappear based on state):**
- **🟢 "MERGE!" button** = Only appears when you have 3 selected
- **🔴 "Clear" button** = Only appears when you have selections to clear

### **Always Available:**
- **🌸 "Add One"** = Add 1 random level 1-2 dessert  
- **🔵 "Fill"** = Add 3 random desserts at once
- **🟠 Orders counter** = Show customer orders (when present)

## ⚡ **Smart Selection Logic**

### **Auto-filtering by Level:**
1. **First click**: Select any dessert → Sets the level filter
2. **Next clicks**: Only same-level desserts can be selected
3. **Green borders**: Show which desserts you CAN select
4. **If you click wrong level**: Selection clears and starts over

### **Deselection:**
- **Click a selected (blue) dessert** = Deselects it
- **Click "Clear" button** = Deselects all
- **Try to select 4th dessert** = Clears all, starts fresh with new dessert

## 🎯 **Example Gameplay**

```

1. Click first 🍪 → Turns blue, green borders appear on other 🍪s
2. Click second 🍪 → Also turns blue, counter shows "2/3 Cookies"  
3. Click third 🍪 → All 3 blue, "MERGE!" button appears
4. Click "MERGE!" → 3 🍪s disappear, 1 🍩 appears in first position
5. Auto-generates 2 new desserts to keep game flowing
```
